[WIP]

This post is a work in progress as I gather my thoughts and notes from my time at Elphinstone Inc.

During my stint at Elphinstone Inc., our dev team was handed a huge challenge: launch a new product in just two months. Leadership decided to pivot from a B2B VPS offering to building a gateway for Pakistani investors to access U.S. markets. It was a much-needed product, but the regulatory landscape was uncharted territory for us—and, let’s be honest, the SECP can be a bit of a grouchy grandpa (kidding, sort of) when it comes to moving money if you’re not a big bank.

One of the biggest hurdles was implementing a robust KYC (Know Your Customer) process for every new signup. From the outset, we knew automation was key—not just for speed, but because the APIs we relied on for KYC checks were prone to errors and downtime. We needed a way to batch up failed requests and retry them at regular intervals, ensuring no customer got left behind due to a flaky third-party service.

This is where Temporal came in. Our CTO discovered this workflow engine, which seemed to tick all the boxes for reliability, retries, and orchestration. (More details on how we integrated Temporal and designed the workflow coming soon!)

**TODO:**

- Expand on the KYC workflow design and challenges
- Dive deeper into how Temporal was used for retries and orchestration
- Share lessons learned and what I’d do differently next time
