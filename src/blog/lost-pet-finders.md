title: Lost Pet Finders – Building a Community-Driven Pet Recovery Platform

Losing a pet is stressful, and finding them shouldn’t be harder than it needs to be. That’s the idea behind Lost Pet Finders (LPF): a public service that helps people track down their lost pets using a mix of geotag devices and human-submitted “spots.” Anyone can register as a spotter, and pet owners can quickly search for their missing companions using a simple, Google-style query bar.

## The Core Concept

At its heart, LPF is about community-driven pet recovery service. The platform combines two main data sources:

- **Spots:** Human-submitted sightings of pets, with details and location.
- **Devices:** Geotag hardware (think Bluetooth beacons or GSM modules) attached to pets for real-time tracking.

This approach isn’t just for cats and dogs—herders and cattle owners can use it to keep tabs on livestock in free-roaming areas.

## Features

- **Quick Locate:** Instantly search for your pet using a query bar.
- **Spot Submission:** Anyone can submit a sighting, with optional auto-breed detection.
- **User Registration:** Become a spotter or register as a pet owner.
- **Shop & Adoption:** Find pet-related products or adopt a new friend.
- **Data Cleanup:** Automatic removal of old spots and found pets to keep the database fresh.
- **Image Optimization:** All images are downsized and converted to JPEG for storage efficiency.
- **Security:** The app follows OWASP protocols to keep user data safe.
- **Alert Feature:** Owners can opt in to receive email notifications if a pet matching their description is spotted or uploaded.

## How It Works

### Data Model

- **Pet Entity:** Each pet has a unique ID, description, color, type, home location, and a history of sightings.
- **GeoTag Device:** Optional hardware for real-time tracking, linked to a pet and (optionally) a user.
- **Users:** Either spotters (who submit sightings) or pet owners.

### Hardware

- **Bluetooth Beacons:** Small, collar-mounted devices (e.g., ESP32) that broadcast the pet’s presence.
- **Mobile Detection:** Registered users’ phones can detect nearby beacons and submit location data.
- **GSM Modules:** For pets that roam far, GSM modules can provide geolocation via cellular networks.

### Image Recognition

A lightweight, local ML model extracts features from pet images to help match lost and found reports. (I’m still learning in this area—shoutout to 3Blue1Brown for the ML crash course.)

## Optimization

- Images are automatically downsized to 1000x1000 px and converted to JPEG for efficient storage.
- A cron job cleans up old spots and found pets to keep the data relevant.

## Market Research

The market for animal tracking is growing fast (CAGR is worth a look). There are already some big players in cattle tracking:

- [LoneStarTracking](https://www.lonestartracking.com/gps-cattle-tracking/)
- [JimiLab](https://www.jimilab.com/api.html)
- [CowManager](https://www.cowmanager.com/cow-management/system/)
- [SemTech](https://www.semtech.com/uploads/technology/LoRa/app-briefs/Semtech_Agr_CattleTracking_AppBrief-FINAL.pdf)
- [Moovement](https://www.moovement.com.au/)
- [Digital Matter](https://www.digitalmatter.com/applications/livestock-tracking/)
- [Postscapes](https://www.postscapes.com/cattle-tracking-systems/)

These are industry-grade products, so it’s worth researching how long they’ve been around and what their market share looks like.

This is still a work in progress, but I’m excited about the potential. If you have ideas, want to collaborate, or just want to chat about lost pets and tech, let me know!
