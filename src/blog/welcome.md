Welcome to my humble blog. This is a space to journal my thoughts, ramblings, and progress updates on things I'm currently working on. Alongside this, I'm hoping to also review my previous projects and possibly make seperate posts for all of them explaining tech decisions and code explainations. To sum it up, this is nerd central right here.
